## [**Linear Regression: Platform & Sales**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/Platform_Sales_LinearRegression.ipynb)

### **Overview**
Sample dataset contians customers activity log.
Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

Goal: To find out correlation of each variable and help the company to decide wether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website!

### **Skills needed**
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, Seaborn

## [**Logistic Regression: Click on Ad**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/Click_on_Ad_LogisticRegression.ipynb)
### **Overview**
Logistic Regression with a fake advertising dataset to predict whether or not a particular user clicked on an Ad online. 


### **Skills needed**
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn

## [**K Nearest Neighbors Project**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/K-Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb)
### **Overview**
KNN Project uses artifical dataset- to predict the target class from 10 different features.
Features are scaled using standardscaler and scaled data is used to be train & predict the data
K value is first selected as 1 and using for loops to plot choose the best K value.
Test result is then expressed in confusion matrix as well as a classification report. 

### **Skills needed**
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn- KNeighborClassifier, StandardScaler 


## [**Random Forest Project work in progress**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/Decision_Trees_and_Random_Forest.ipynb)
