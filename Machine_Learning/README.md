## [**Linear Regression: Platform & Sales**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/Platform_Sales_LinearRegression.ipynb)

### **Overview**
Sample dataset contians customers activity log.
Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

Goal: To find out correlation of each variable and help the company to decide wether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website!

### **Skills needed**
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, Seaborn

## [**Logistic Regression: Click on Ad**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/Click_on_Ad_LogisticRegression.ipynb)
### **Overview**
Logistic Regression with a fake advertising dataset to predict whether or not a particular user clicked on an Ad online. 


### **Skills needed**
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn

## [**K Nearest Neighbors Project**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/K-Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb)
### **Overview**
KNN Project uses artifical dataset- to predict the target class from 10 different features.
Features are scaled using standardscaler and scaled data is used to be train & predict the data
K value is first selected as 1 and using for loops to plot choose the best K value.
Test result is then expressed in confusion matrix as well as a classification report. 

### **Skills needed**
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn- KNeighborClassifier, StandardScaler 


## [**Loan estimate - Random Forest Project**](https://github.com/suhsunghee/suhsunghee.github.io/blob/main/Machine_Learning/Projects/Loan_Estimate_DecisionTree_RandomForest.ipynb)
### **Overview**
Data from LendingClub.com during 2007-2010 is used to predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
Decision tree and random forest are both ran on loan estimate data.
First data has been visualized to see FICO score and loan status as well as the purpose of the loan & FICO score relationship.
From this excercise, random forest had 95% less of Type 1 error ( false positive) value than that of decision tree

## **Skills needed**
Python-get_dummies, pandas, Seaborn, sklearn-randomforest,decisiontree,
